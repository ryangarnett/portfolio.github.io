  <div class="portfolioStory"><class="pStoryText" p>Information and data are becoming increasingly important for municipal governments. Transitioning to a Smart City requires access to not only data, but the knowledge to analyze and provide insights to urban leaders. Urban municipalities are relying on technology as an enabler of efficiencies an to provide an avenue for data driven decision marking.</p><br>
    <class="pStoryText" p>During my time with the City of Toronto I have had many opportunities to work on some exciting technology and data initiative. For greater detail click on the image to view the project.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <div class="leftText"><p>Co-developed with community, the City of Toronto Open Data Master Plan gathered information from the public, start-ups, local businesses, and academics on elements that will enable the local commmunity to develop meaningful services and provide insights related to data driven decision making.</p><br>
      <p>Information collected through the numerous community engagements were analyzed and synthesized to generate four themes. The themes consist of actions that provide insights into the deliveries of the Master Plan.</p></div>

      <div class="rightText"><p>Developed using design-thinking and co-development principles, the new Open Data Portal is a significant improvement from the existing site, providing improved search and in application visualization capibilities. With 24/7 real-time access to the Open Data Portal allows anyone to leverage City data to accomplish work and reduce duplication of effort, while helping solve civic issues, with the results benefiting the public.</p><br>
      <p>Utilizing open source technology, the portal development is shared on the City's Github site, allowing anyone to access, improve, or take advantage of the development.</p></div>

    <div class="project">
      <div class="leftText"><p>On May 24, 2016 during the City of Toronto Executive Committee meeting, executive motion 15.25, raised “explore consolidating the Chief Information Officer and City Clerks open data responsibilities into one role to be administered through the office of the City Manager with the possibility of creating a Chief Data Officer (CDO) role”. The request from Executive Committee was added to the City’s Open Data Master Plan within Theme 2b, specifically “Explore creation of a Chief Data Officer role to take ownership of the Open Data program and related areas”.</p><br>
      <p>The municipal Chief Data Officer role was analyzed using a report from the Harvard Kennedy School that consisted of 19 US examples. The analysis was performed in RStudio within a RNotebook, providing transparency into the methods and results.</p></div>

      <div class="rightText"><p>The City of Toronto's MapSales is a service that provides geospatial data for consultants and contractors working on city projects. Many city divisions utilize the service to provide the numerous geo data products to consulting partners. The service has been operational for over a decade, but with the increase availability and popularity in open data the utilization of the MapSales service is in question.</p><br>
      <p>MapSales service was analyzed using raw data generated from the system between 2013 and 2016. The analysis was performed in RStudio within a RNotebook, providing transparency into the methods and results.</p></div>
