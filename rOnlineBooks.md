R Books
-------

R is an amazing language for data analytics, data science, and data visualizations. There are amazing packages and functions that allow you to do almost anything you can think of in the data domain. Best of all is the R community! I have been on my *R journey* for the past year and a half, and during that time I have used a number of resources. I was blown away when I came across the number of amazing books that are available freely online; a true testimony to the R community! This is my contribution back to our community. I will continue to update the site as I find more R online resources. **Happy R'ing!**

### Advanced R

***By: Hadley Wickham*** <br> With more than 10 years experience programming in R, I’ve had the luxury of being able to spend a lot of time trying to figure out and understand how the language works. This book is my attempt to pass on what I’ve learned so that you can quickly become an effective R programmer. Reading it will help you avoid the mistakes I’ve made and dead ends I’ve gone down, and will teach you useful tools, techniques, and idioms that can help you to attack many types of problems. In the process, I hope to show that, despite its frustrating quirks, R is, at its heart, an elegant and beautiful language, well tailored for data analysis and statistics. <br> Available [here](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)

### Advanced R solutions

***By: Malte Grosser & Henning Bumann*** <br> This book offers solutions to the exercises from Hadley Wickham’s book Advanced R (Edition 2). It is work in progress and under active development. The 2nd edition of Advanced R is still being revised, but we hope to provide most of the answers in 2019. <br> Available [here](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/)

### blogdown: creating websites with R markdown

***By: Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas & Alison Presmanes Hill*** <br> We introduce an R package, blogdown, in this short book, to teach you how to create websites using R Markdown and Hugo. If you have experience with creating websites, you may naturally ask what the benefits of using R Markdown are, and how blogdown is different from existing popular website platforms, such as WordPress. <br> Available [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)

### Geocomputation in R

***By: Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad & Jannes Muenchow*** <br> This book is for people who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software. It is based on R, a statistical programming language that has powerful data processing, visualization and geospatial capabilities. The book covers a wide range of topics and will be of interest to a wide range of people from many different backgrounds. <br> Available [here](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)

### Forecasting

***By: Rob J Hyndman & George Athanasopoulos*** <br> This textbook is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to forecasting methods and to present enough information about each method for readers to be able to use them sensibly. We don’t attempt to give a thorough discussion of the theoretical details behind each method, although the references at the end of each chapter will fill in many of those details. <br> Available [here](https://otexts.com/fpp2/)

### Intro to GIS and spatial analysis

***By: Manuel Gimond*** <br> These pages are a compilation of lecture notes for my Introduction to GIS and Spatial Analysis course (ES214). They are ordered in such a way to follow the course outline, but most pages can be read in any desirable order. The course (and this book) is split into two parts: data manipulation & visualization and exploratory spatial data analysis. The first part of this book is usually conducted using ArcGIS Desktop whereas the latter part of the book is conducted in R. ArcGIS was chosen as the GIS data manipulation environment because of its “desirability” in job applications for undergraduates in the Unites States. But other GIS software environments, such as the open source software QGIS, could easily be adopted in lieu of ArcGIS–even R can be used to perform many spatial data manipulations such as clipping, buffering and projecting. Even though some of the chapters of this book make direct reference to ArcGIS techniques, most chapters can be studied without access to the software. <br> Available [here](https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/index.html)

### ggplot2

***By: Hadley Wickham*** <br> Welcome to the second edition of "ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis". I'm so excited to have an updated book that shows off all the latest and greatest ggplot2 features, as well as the great things that have been happening in R and in the ggplot2 community the last five years. The ggplot2 community is vibrant: the ggplot2 mailing list has over 7,000 members and there is a very active Stack Overflow community, with nearly 10,000 questions tagged with ggplot2. While most of my development effort is no longer going into ggplot2 (more on that below), there's never been a better time to learn it and use it.

I am tremendously grateful for the success of ggplot2. It's one of the most commonly downloaded R packages (over a million downloads in the last year!) and has influenced the design of graphics packages for other languages. Personally, ggplot2 has bought me many exciting opportunities to travel the world and meet interesting people. I love hearing how people are using R and ggplot2 to understand the data that they care about.

A big thanks for this edition goes to Carson Sievert, who helped me modernise the code, including converting the sources to R Markdown. He also updated many of the examples and helped me proofread the book.

### R for data science

***By: Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham*** <br> This is the website for “R for Data Science”. This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data. <br> Available [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

### R graphics cookbook

***By: Winston Chang*** <br> Welcome to the R Graphics Cookbook, a practical guide that provides more than 150 recipes to help you generate high-quality graphs quickly, without having to comb through all the details of R’s graphing systems. Each recipe tackles a specific problem with a solution you can apply to your own project, and includes a discussion of how and why the recipe works. <br> Available [here](https://r-graphics.org/)

### R Markdown: the definitive guide

***By: Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire & Garrett Grolemund*** <br> The document format “R Markdown” was first introduced in the knitr package (Xie 2015, 2019b) in early 2012. The idea was to embed code chunks (of R or other languages) in Markdown documents. In fact, knitr supported several authoring languages from the beginning in addition to Markdown, including LaTeX, HTML, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, and Textile. Looking back over the five years, it seems to be fair to say that Markdown has become the most popular document format, which is what we expected. The simplicity of Markdown clearly stands out among these document formats. <br> Available [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

### R packages

***By: Hadley Wickham*** <br> If you’re serious about software development, you need to learn about Git. Git is a version control system, a tool that tracks changes to your code and shares those changes with others. Git is most useful when combined with GitHub, a website that allows you to share your code with the world, solicit improvements via pull requests and track issues. Git + GitHub is the most popular version control system for developers of R packages (witness the thousands of R packages hosted on GitHub). <br> Available [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html)

### Visualization

***By: Claus O. Wilke*** <br> The book is meant as a guide to making visualizations that accurately reflect the data, tell a story, and look professional. It has grown out of my experience of working with students and postdocs in my laboratory on thousands of data visualizations. Over the years, I have noticed that the same issues arise over and over. I have attempted to collect my accumulated knowledge from these interactions in the form of this book. <br> Available [here](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/)

### Visualization decision tree

***By: Yan Holtz & Conor Healy*** <br> From Data to Viz leads you to the most appropriate graph for your data. It links to the code to build it and lists common caveats you should avoid. <br> Available [here](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)
